Trainsquare is an educational and skills platform which allows its users to host their own in-person and online workshops as well as book courses, lessons and activities. Trainqure is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Attendance feature.
